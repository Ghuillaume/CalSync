Installation :

	You need to install libqt4 first, if it's not installed yet. Then, two ways are possible to compile the program :
	
	1- Just execute install.sh. This needs cmake to be installed.
	2- Install libqjson paquet and then execute make
	

Usage :

	If you have some libqjson errors when you launch the application, check LIBS variable in Makefile, maybe libqjson.so isn't in the right folder.
	You need to have an Internet connection with no proxy to use communication features.
